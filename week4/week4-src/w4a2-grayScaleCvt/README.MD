## Assignment 1: Batch Grayscale

You have learned:

- how to convert an image to grayscale, and
- how to select and process several images to convert them to grayscale and display them.
- You also learned how to copy an image and save it with a different filename.

Now put this all together in one program that:

- batch processes several images, and
- creates and saves new images (with new filenames) that are grayscale versions of each image.

More specifically,

- Your program should let the user select multiple image files
- For each image, create a new image that is a grayscale version of the original image
- For each image, save the grayscale image in a new file with the same filename as the original image, but with the word "__gray-__" in front of the filename. For example, if the original file was named `lion.png`, the new image would be a grayscale image and be named `gray-lion.png`.
- Hint: Start with the Batch Grayscale program that processes many images, and add in code to save those files with new names.
