# Week 1: Seven steps in Action

Developing an algorithm

--------------------------------------------
Problem: Given a shape, find its perimeter
--------------------------------------------

## Step 1: Work an Instance yourself

That's mean you need to draw shape and find it perimeter.
Specifically, what is the perimeter of a shape.

## Step 2: Write down what you just did

1. Found distance from 1st point to 2nd point (it was _4_)
2. Found distance from 2nd point to 3rd point (it was _5_)
3. Added 4 + 5 = 9
4. Found the distance from 3rd point to 4th point (it was _5_)
5. Added 9 + 5 = 14
6. Found distance from 4th point to 1st point (it was _2_)
7. Added 14 + 2 = 16
8. Said 16 is my answer

## Step 3: Generalize

Now we find patterns and generalize to find the perimeter of any shape,
not just the one we just saw.

One thing you might notice is that we're doing almost the same thing repeatedly.
When we generalize, we want to look for similar steps and express them as repetition.
