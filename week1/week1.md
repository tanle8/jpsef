# Note on week 1's lessons

## Seven steps for solving programming problem

1. Work example by __Hand__
2. __Write down__ what you did
3. __Find patterns__
4. Check by __Hand__
5. __Translate__ to Code
6. Run __Test Cases__
7. __Debug__ Failed Test Cases

### 1. Work example by __Hand__

- Solve small instance by hand
    - with small pieces of data
- Unclear problem?
- Need domain knowledge?

### 2. __Write down__ what you did
